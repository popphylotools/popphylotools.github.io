## Welcome to popphylotools at GitHub

Here you will find tools developed for phylogenetic and population genetic analysis. 

## [HiMAP](https://popphylotools.github.io/HiMAP/)
Bioinformatic locus selection and data processing pipelines used in Dupuis et al. 2017 (submitted) for generating phylogenomic datasets using the HiMAP approach.

## [mvMapper](https://popphylotools.github.io/mvMapper/)
mvMapper is an interactive data exploration tool for multivariate analyses with associated geographic location information.

## [phylo-fasta-fudger](https://popphylotools.github.io/phylo-fasta-fudger/)
This tool "fills in" or "fudges" individual-specific missing data in phylogenomic datasets by substituting missing individuals' data with that of their closest relative (determined from a reference phylogeny). This can facilitate analyses that require no missing data (e.g. using gene trees to estimate a species tree where all gene trees must have the same taxa).
